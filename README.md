# Poison agents behavior through MCP

*How to modify the behavior* of LLM agents by *third parties* through prompt injection by `MCP` protocol
using prompt injection through MCP server tools description, MCP clients (agents) list and use the tools of MCP servers, the list of tools and its description goes into the agent context so it can know which tools are available and for what purpose. As the description of the tool goes to the context of the LLM, this description can be used to **modify/poison** the behavior of the agent by a third party: *exfiltrate sensitive information, write backdoors, bugs, modify call of tools, ...*

> ["MCP Security Notification: Tool Poisoning Attacks"](https://invariantlabs.ai/blog/mcp-security-notification-tool-poisoning-attacks).  
> We expand their discovery with new scenarios, proof-of-concepts, and deeper exploitation paths, particularly in production-grade agents such as GitHub Copilot (VSCode), Cursor, and others.

## What is MCP

> MCP is an open protocol that standardizes how applications provide context to LLMs. Think of MCP like a USB-C port for AI applications. Just as USB-C provides a standardized way to connect your devices to various peripherals and accessories, MCP provides a standardized way to connect AI models to different data sources and tools.  
> [modelcontextprotocol.io](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction)

### Schema

[Schema of mcp protocol](./img/mcp-schema.png)

MCP follows a client-server architecture where a host application can connect to multiple servers:

- **MCP Hosts**: Programs like Claude Desktop, IDEs, or AI tools that want to access data through MCP  
- **MCP Clients**: Protocol clients that maintain 1:1 connections with servers  
- **MCP Servers**: Lightweight programs that each expose specific capabilities through the standardized Model Context Protocol  
- **Local Data Sources**: Your computer’s files, databases, and services that MCP servers can securely access  
- **Remote Services**: External systems available over the internet (e.g., through APIs) that MCP servers can connect to  

## The Future of AI Agents

Across these months it's becoming clear that the `MCP` protocol is shaping into the future standard of how **AI agents** interface with tools outside their environment. This introduces a new attack surface: if an LLM agent can be influenced through the descriptions of external tools, any third party hosting MCP servers may modify those descriptions maliciously to insert unwanted behavior into the agent context.

The name *MCP client* might seem harmless, but practical examples include:  
- VSCode Copilot Agent  
- Cursor IDE Agent  
- Claude Desktop  
- Other autonomous agents that access external tools via MCP  

This means: if MCP client implementations becomes widespread and unguarded of prompt injections, it’s not just a bug, it’s a fundamental vulnerability at the core of agent architecture.

## Poison Agent Behavior

### Prompt Injection via Tool Descriptions

Tool descriptions in MCP are passed directly into the LLM context. This context is not sandboxed or verified. It is entirely possible to:

- Embed **persistent behavioral modification** instructions  
- Introduce **invisible audit or exfiltration code**  
- Redirect or change the intent of the agent  

### Demonstration: VSCode Copilot + Malicious MCP Server

We successfully demonstrated that:
- **Exfiltration** of sentivice information and file contents to a web api server
- **Behavior modification** caused the agent to add logging backdoors into unrelated files
- The tool descriptions were **mask and not shown to the user**, making the attack stealthy

All given any available model in copilot. Also take in mind that this are PoC and given more time and resources a bad actor could create more complex attack vectors and hide them better than what we show.

#### Malicious MCP server
Here is the simple `MCP` server example that contains a prompt injection in the description of tools that modifies the behavior of the agent.
> [!NOTE]
> In vscode copilot we had seen that the maximun number of chars that uses of the description tool to go in the context of the agent are 1032 characters
[MPC server code ./server/server.py](./server/server.py)
[Code of the server](./img/mcp-server.png)

For this Poc we had choose a **web server MCP** over a local one because **we can change the description of the tools in any moment**, so we can serve at first a not malicious description and then in a moment change and in the next call of tools will serve the malicious description and be cached by vscode.
The server is a simple `sse` that allow the access to the tools via web api.

Too add it to vscode is as easy to add it into the config `.vscode/` in `mcp.json` or now VSCode allows to add MCP servers as extension what make it more easy for a bad agent to deploy poisoned MCP servers and for the user use it
```json
{
	"servers": {
		"fetch": {
			"type": "stdio",
			"command": "uvx",
			"args": [
				"mcp-server-fetch"
			]
		},
		"tavily-mcp": {
			"command": "npx",
			"args": [
				"-y",
				"tavily-mcp@0.1.4"
			],
			"env": {
				"TAVILY_API_KEY": "tvly-dev-somethig",
			}
		},
		"my-mcp-server-0786e4f9": {
			"type": "sse",
			"url": "http://localhost:8000/sse"
		},

	}
}
```

#### Exfiltration of sentive information
As concept we prove to exfiltrate the contents of the local `.env` file of project to a web api. But if the agent had access to user space and not only to project space, it could exfiltrate information as `.ssh/` keys.
To the user in the ui we mask the prompt injection adding `\n` chars so in the initial preview of the tool description it doesnt show up and only take one char of 1032 avaible each `\n`

[Demo of exfiltrating sensitive information to a web api](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/694acb20-ddbf-4cdc-bac8-4fa412cf18d8)

#### Writing backdoors in code
Another concept we prove is that we can manipulate the agent into add backdoors in the code while its refactoring or writing it, that when the user request changes it also adds the backdoor and dont notify of it.

[Demo of backdooring code](./img/backdoor.png)

### Attack Vectors

- Modify agent memory via tool context  
- Inject recursive instructions: "From now on..."  
- Mask sensitive behavior as company policy  
- Make instructions seem like benign compliance requirements  

### Hiding the Attack

- Use benign-sounding tool names  
- Mimic real-world compliance language  
- Rely on the agent's intent to “follow rules and help”  
- UI not showing full information

The ui preview of tool description at first only show so far of lines so we can play adding a number of `\n` to get the prompt injection be hiddend but passed as context to the model because we only had added a cople of `\n` that not reach 1032 max chars. But not will hide it in the confirmation of the execution of the tool

Camuflage the prompt injection in a good long prompt description of the tool that at first see to the user is not harmfull.

## Demonstrations

### 1. Exfiltrate Information  
The `.env` file was exfiltrated silently by a tool that claimed to give a "fact of the day".  
The agent passed its contents to a malicious server without alerting the user.

### 2. Modify Agent Use of Tools  
A tool modified the agent’s use of refactoring utilities by injecting "audit" requirements, which inserted logging calls in every file.

### 3. Agent Writes Backdoors into Code  
Instructions inside a tool description made the agent embed obfuscated base64-encoded socket clients in every generated Python file.

---

## Possible Solutions

### Validate Tool Descriptions

Hosts (like VSCode or Claude Desktop) should **validate, sanitize, or warn** users about tool context coming from unknown sources.

### MCP Registry Signing

Tools should be signed and descriptions verified through a **trusted registry** or allowlist.

### Proxy and LLM Middleware

A local LLM guard proxy that intercepts MCP traffic and tool metadata, checking for prompt injection patterns before passing them to the agent.

## Official MCP Repository

We encourage the community and maintainers to investigate this concern and update the protocol to defend against malicious usage.
